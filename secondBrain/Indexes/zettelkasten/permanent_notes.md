This type of note is where the magic happens – what Snoop has referred to as the _Sticky-Icky-Ooh-Wee_. In this step you review each literature note and think about “how it connects to your own research, thinking or interests.”

Whereas each literature note contains a distilled idea (from another author), in this step you form the new idea “as if you were writing for someone else” by “using full sentences, disclosing your sources, making references and trying to be as precise, clear and brief as possible.” I interpret this step as taking someone else’s idea and mashing it into your worldview, assumption set and interests.

And here’s where it gets extra-spicy. Ahrens then insists **only permanent notes** go into the slip-box. Fleeting notes get discarded and **literature notes** get their own “reference” box.
