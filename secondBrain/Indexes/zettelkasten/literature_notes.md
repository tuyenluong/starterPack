Literature notes most closely resemble the more brute-force approach of exporting your Kindle highlights into a note-taking app like Evernote, Notion or Roam.

But that’s where the similarities end. While the “copy-paste-export” approach does make your notes searchable, it injects **a ton of noise** into your workflow – diminishing the odds of **identifying a valuable signal.**
