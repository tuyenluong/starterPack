To use _productivity parlance_ this is nothing more than a **quick capture** process into your favourite app. (As an aside, I’ve been LOVING the [Drafts app](https://getdrafts.com/) as a workaround for Notion’s slow-ish capture and Roam’s lack of mobile app.)

```dataview
table Creation_date, Modification_date
from [[fleeting_notes]]  sort Creation_date DESC
```
